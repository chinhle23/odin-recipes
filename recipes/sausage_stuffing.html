    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This classic sausage stuffing, packed with bold flavor and made with simple ingredients, will quickly become a holiday tradition. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sausage: This recipe starts with a pound of breakfast sausage.</li>
      <li>Butter: Cook the vegetables in a mix of butter and sausage drippings.</li>
      <li>Vegetables: You’ll need finely diced celery and a chopped onion. </li>
      <li>Bread: The white bread cubes should ideally be slightly stale. If your bread seems too soft, lightly toast it in the oven. </li>
      <li>Seasonings: Season the sausage stuffing with poultry seasoning and ground black pepper. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

      <li>Pour the drippings into a measuring cup with melted butter.</li>
      <li>Cook the vegetables in the dripping-butter mixture.</li>
      <li>Stir in ⅓ of the bread cubes, then transfer the vegetable mixture to the sausage bowl.</li>
      <li>Add the remaining ingredients and mix well.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and butter an appropriately sized dish.</li>
      <li>Place stuffing mixture in the prepared dish and cover.</li>
      <li>Place the dish in a pan of hot water and bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and crisp on top, basting occasionally with turkey drippings.</li>
