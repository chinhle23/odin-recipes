    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Note that this recipe calls for canned pumpkin, not "pumpkin pie filling," which is already spiced. If you plan to use the spices and sweeteners called for in this recipe, go for unflavored canned pumpkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      While there's no shame in using canned pumpkin, some folks prefer the flavor and satisfaction you get from using fresh pumpkin. If that's you, use this recipe for making pumpkin puree from scratch. A 1 ½-pound pumpkin yields about 2 cups mashed pumpkin, the same as a 15-ounce can of pumpkin puree.

      <li>1 (14 ounce) can Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk</li>
