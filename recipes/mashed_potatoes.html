    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The best potatoes for mashing depends on your personal preference, as some varieties will give you fluffy results while others will give you creamy results.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recipe calls for baking potatoes (a.k.a. russets), which are ideal for light and fluffy mashed potatoes. A good all-purpose potato, such as Yukon Gold, is also always a crowd-pleaser.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled, or to taste (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and garlic, lower heat to medium, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>When the potatoes are almost finished, heat milk and butter in a small saucepan over low heat until butter is melted.</li>
      <li>Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Slowly add warm milk mixture, blending it in with a potato masher or electric mixer until potatoes are smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
